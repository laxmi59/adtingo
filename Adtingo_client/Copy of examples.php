      <p>You only pay for the recipients you wish to reach. Target your list of recipients and choose to send to them all or specify the exact number to reach. Each campaign costs $50 plus $.03 per recipient.</p>
      <p>We offer a variety of discounts for big spenders.  For example if you want to reach over 85,000 recipients your campaign fee drops to $25 plus $0.03 per recipient.  For 150,000 recipients or more your $50 is waived completely and will only pay $0.025 per recipient over 150,000.</p>
