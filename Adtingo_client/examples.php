  <p>When creating a campaign you will have two templates to choose from, a vertical or horizontal oriented template.  The templates are exactly the same with regards to the infomation you are allowed to send, the only major difference being the size of the image in each, either 590x390 or 313x406.  Both templates require, a Subject Line, Destination link where you would like us to send recipients, Title, Sub Title, 200 Word Content, Website URL, Physical Address, and Phone Number. You may also include optional information like hours of operation or Links to Facebook or Twitter pages. We tried to make the process as straight forward and easy to use as posible.  Get Started today and see for yourself just how easy it is to create a beautiful email campaign.</p>
