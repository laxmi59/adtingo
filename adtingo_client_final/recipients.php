      <p>Gone are the days of sending expensive campaigns to hundreds of thousands or even millions of recipients you know nothing about, in hopes that someone will be interested in what you have to say.  With Adtingo you can send a targeted message to the 2000 people in your zip code that want to hear from you, for a fraction of the cost.</p>
      <h2 class="headlinetwo">Relevance</h2>
      <div class="boxpicslside"><img src="images/image-recepientsrelevance.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="90" /></div>
      <p>Irrelevance is one the most common negative associations of email advertising among consumers. Recipients are tired of receiving emails that are irrelevant to them.  This could be something as simple as a male receiving an email advertisement clearly meant for females, or an advertisement for a store that doesn’t even operate in their state. That’s where you, local businesses and advertisers, come in.  You represent something relevant for recipients, they may not know who you are, but the fact that you do business in the same city possibly even the same zip code makes what you have to say that much more engaging and enticing.</p>
      <h2 class="headlinetwo">Frequency</h2>
      <div class="boxpicsrside"><img src="images/image-recepientsfrequency.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="75" /></div>
      <p>One of our goals is to keep our recipients as interested and engaged as possible.  We work to ensure their happiness by limiting the numbers of messages they receive from us to a maximum of one email per day.  If they choose they can turn down this frequency to as low as once per year, or choose to be totally removed from our list all together. What this does for you is guarantees that recipients are 100% engaged in what you have to say since you will not be competing for their attention that day with other emails from us.</p>
      <h2 class="headlinetwo">Protection</h2>
      <div class="boxpicslside"><img src="images/image-recepientsprotection.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="100" /></div>
      <p>We respect the privacy of our subscribers and never disclose any information about them to any advertiser.  When you work with Adtingo you are not simply buying a list of names and emails.  You tell us through demographic targeting who you want to reach and we in turn send the campaign on your behalf to the recipients that match the requested demographics.</p>
